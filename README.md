# Illness Simulator

This is a college work made in 2017. It studies the behavior of virus spread
through population. These studies explore the best strategies of vaccination 
as long as the virus is spreading.

The simulation can be represented by either network graph animation (node + edge) or 
traditional graphics. For network graph, each node represents a person of population and
each edge represents the relationship of one person with other
(e.g. teacher with student)
